# BookHaven


  BookHaven is a self-learning iOS project designed to provide users with a personalized book discovery experience. The app allows users to browse a curated list of books based on their interests and genres. Users can explore different categories of books and find recommendations tailored to their preferences, with an option to purchase books directly.

This project is built using UICollectionView to display books in an elegant, scrollable grid layout, providing a smooth and visually appealing interface for users to navigate through their favorite titles.



# Feature

 1.  Personalized Book Recommendations: Users can browse books based on their interests and discover new reads.
2. Grid Layout with Collection View: The app uses a collection view to showcase books in a visually appealing and organized grid format.
3. Book Details & Purchase Option: Users can view detailed information about each book and proceed to buy them with just a few taps.
4. Smooth User Interface: Clean and simple UI for a seamless browsing experience.


# Future Feature

   In future updates, BookHaven will introduce new features such as:

User Reviews & Ratings: Users will be able to leave reviews and rate books they have read.
Wishlist: Users will have the ability to save books to a wishlist for future reference.
Social Sharing: Allowing users to share their favorite books and recommendations with friends on social media.
Advanced Search Filters: Providing more robust search options to help users find books based on specific criteria (e.g., author, genre, price).


# Current Status 
The app is still in development and is not yet launched on the App Store. It is a self-learning project aimed at enhancing my skills in iOS development, specifically working with UICollectionView.
